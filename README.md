# TrailBlazer
This program finds a path through a maze given by a file

An example maze is the following:
OP|PPPP
|PPP|PP
||||||P
|||||PP
||||||P
PPPPPPP
PPP||||
||PP|||
|||PPPX

The O is the starting point from which the computer starts from.
Following a path designated by the letter P, the computer has to go from the O to the X.
The computer may not go through the | symbols as they represent obstacles. Thus the computer has to go around it.
